          2: 'When you are writing an assignment, it is important to <strong> answer the question being asked </strong> and not just the one you want to answer or the one you assume is being asked. One of the biggest challenges that students face both in assignments and exams is understanding the question that is actually being asked. It may be surprising, but this is where a lot of students make mistakes. <br /><br /> The first step to making sure that you submit a high-quality assignment is to fully understand the assignment question. Ensuring that your assignment remains on target is important, as you may lose marks for content that does not address the question properly, or that is in the wrong format.',
          3: '<strong>Read and Review Instructions:</strong> <br /><br /> Read your assignment instructions. Note the word count and marking criteria, called a ruberic, which is usually available on the course page on The Hub. Double-check the due date and what format the assignment should be submitted in. Clarify any doubts with your lecturer if you need to.',
          4: '<strong>Identify Key Components:</strong> <br /><br /> Look for keywords in your assignment question or brief that tell you what to do. Examples should be asking you to "evaluate", "describe", or "assess"? <br /><br /> Highlight or make note of any of the keywords that are related to your subject or course specifically (in Film, this might be "cinematography" or "genre analysis". In Psychology, it might be "cognitive development" or "behavioural therapy". In Business, it might be "ethics")',
          5: '<strong>Analyse the Question:</strong> <br /><br /> When approaching an asssignment, the first thing to do is read the question or brief fully and carefully. Then, reread it. Look out for the following things: topic words, directional words, the focus of the question and the limiting scope. <br /> <br /> The topic words tell you what the question is about, while the directional words tell you what you need to do. <br /> <br /> The focus of the question is the specific angle or lens that the question takes regarding the subject matter. It may also be an opinion, a theory, or a specific viewpoint. <br /><br /> The limiting scope limits the focus of the question, e.g., to a particular time period, theory, place, number, etc. '

          3: '<strong>Use Each Source to Lead to Another:</strong> <br /><br /> If you are not sure where to start researching, look at some resources your lecturer may have given you. You can build up a basic understanding using these, and then research more specifically when you understand your topic area. The citations and references in these can point you to more specific research in a particular area. When researching, think outside the box - using keywords that are adjacent but related to your topic could give you other results and perspectives. For example, the different keywords "sport", "football", and "World Cup" might give you different results/sources.',

Showing your lecturer that you are <a href="https://iadt.libguides.com/findinginfo" target="_blank"> engaged critically </a> will deliver a better result for you in the end.',
